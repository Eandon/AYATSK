# AYATSK

This code is a Python implementation of the paper "Adaptive Yager T-Norm Based Takagi-Sugeno-Kang Fuzzy Systems"

The paper proposes adaptive strategy for Yager T-norm and a composite exponential membership function, based on which 
a novel Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy model is derived, i.e., AYATSK. This fuzzy approach is suitable for solving both
low- and high-dimensional tasks.

The code requires:
* python (>= 3.10)
* torch (>= 1.9.0)
* scikit-learn (>= 1.0.2)
